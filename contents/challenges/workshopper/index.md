For this weeks challenge we are going to think about how to transfer knowledge to other developers.
You can pick a topic you are familiar with or something that you already wanted research, but did not have a purpose for it yet.
Think about topics like: functional programming fundamentals, classical inheritance pattern in Javascript, chat bot's, text based games, competition pattern, regular expression you name it. Do not feel limited to these topics at all, these are just to get you thinking.

In this challenge there are a few requirements.

- You must use the [Workshopper framework](https://github.com/workshopper/workshopper).
- Exercise's should be written in English.
- The workshop must be published to [npmjs.com](http://npmjs.com/)
- The source code must be on [Github.com](https://github.com)

Submissions can be sent in via this [form](http://goo.gl/forms/K2UoE7KoZr)
