First of all let me say Merry Christmas! Last weeks challenge was a blast and I'd like to thanks everybody who submitted a solution.
To view the submitted solutions check the [results section of the challenge](http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/pythagoras-tree/results).

For this weeks challenge I wanted to something Christmas themed and came up with a lot of ideas, but since we can not spend the entire week working on the challenge I thought to go for something simple: Let it snow.

You are free to decide how to do the snow flakes, you can do it in the old Nintendo style like this:

Or you can use [Koch snowflake's](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Koch_snowflake).

Or if you feel really simple you can just grab an image of a snowflake and repeat that.
Try to make this as efficient as you can, by reusing snowflake's for instance.

Once again I created a [template](http://codepen.io/DailyJavascript/pen/KVgyKV) for you so you can a nice starting point.

With last challenge I asked you to submit to via email, since this cluttered up my Inbox like crazy I created a Google form  for submissions.
I do ask you to only submit Codepen version's of your implementation. I require this because if the embed functionality.
