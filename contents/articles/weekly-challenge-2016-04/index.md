As first point of today here are [last weeks results](http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/tic-tac-toe/results).
Sadly still not a lot of submissions. The submissions I did receive are amazing great work guys.
I am curious about the reason behind the low number of submissions, is this because the challenges are to hard?
Or because they are not challenging enough? Maybe you guys don't like the topics. I do not know.
Please tell me if you have any ideas on how I can get you guys to work on challenging problems and you will have fun.

For this weeks challenge I had a fun idea, but sadly I did not find the time this week to prepare it.
So that will have to wait for some other week. This week we are gonna think about how to transfer knowledge.

Pick a topic which you feel comfortable with or something you find interesting and create a workshop for that topic.
You will be using the [Workshopper](https://github.com/workshopper/workshopper) framework which I mentioned [this week](http://daily-javascript.com/articles/workshopper/).
For more detail on the challenge go to the [challenge page](http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/workshopper).
