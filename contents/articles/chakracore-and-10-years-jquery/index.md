ChakraCore (GitHub: [Microsoft/ChakraCore](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore), License: MIT)

In case you did not see or hear it yet, Microsoft has open sourced the ChakraCore.
ChakraCore is the Javascript engine that powers Microsoft Edge.

The ChakraCore repository provides a fully supported and open-source standalone JavaScript engine, with the same  as the Microsoft Edgeâ€™s Chakra engine, to embed within your projects.

For more in depth information I would refer you to the [official post by Microsoft](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/01/13/chakracore-now-open/). When you don't feel like reading that, just watch this [announcement video](https://youtu.be/1bfDB3YPHFI).

Besides the great news coming from Microsoft, jQuery has a special day to celebrate. The ten year existence of the most used library on the web.
The first release was at 14th of January 2006. Since then it has changed a lot and helped evolve the web to the great platform it is nowadays.

Go over to the [jQuery blog](http://blog.jquery.com/2016/01/14/ten-years-of-jquery-and-beyond/) to read a little bit about the journey to today.
