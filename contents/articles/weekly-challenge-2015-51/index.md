Since I started missing a lot of Friday posts, I came up with a new section for which I can prepare during the week.

Iâ€™m introducing Weekly Challenges. Every Friday I will post an assignment related to programming. These challenges can be math problems, mathematical phenomenons or building something using a previously mentioned library.

These assignments are to challenges yourself. This is not a competition. I will do my best to design/pick challenges that will be interesting for developers of all skill levels.
But do not feel limited to the challenge description, if you can create something more complex than the challenge describes, do it!

If you have great idea's for futures challenges please submit it via [this Google Form](http://goo.gl/forms/8FaZJSBxjO).

An overview of the challenges can be found at [/challenges](/challenges). This weeks challenge is the [Pythagoras Tree](/challenges/pythagoras-tree/).
