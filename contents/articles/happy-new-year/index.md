First of all let me say Merry Christmas! Last weeks challenge was a blast and I'd like to thanks everybody who submitted a solution.
To view the submitted solutions check the [results section of the challenge](http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/pythagoras-tree/results).

For this weeks challenge I wanted to something Christmas themed and came up with a lot of ideas, but since we can not spend the entire week working on the challenge I thought to go for something simple: Let it snow.

An overview of the challenges can be found at [/challenges](/challenges). For more details about this weeks challenge go to [Let it snow](http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/let-it-snow/).
