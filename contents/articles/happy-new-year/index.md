First of all let me say Happy new year! The last couple of weeks I did not do any posted due to all the celebrations and illness.
Luckily the holiday season is over and we can get back to creating and learning to make beautiful applications.
Something some people might be interested in is the results of the latest challenge which was ["Let it snow"](http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/let-it-snow).

Well sadly I only received two submissions. Which let me to believe people did not feel challenged by this assignment. I will do my best to find something more interesting.
The results can be found on the results page of the challenge which would be [Daily-Javascript.com/challenges/let-it-snow/results](http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/let-it-snow/results)

From tomorrow on Daily-Javascript will be getting daily updates again. Hope you guys keep on reading.

Happy coding.
