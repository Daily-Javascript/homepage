Workshopper (GitHub: [workshopper/workshopper](https://github.com/workshopper/workshopper), License: MIT, npm: workshopper)

Workshopper is a terminal workshop runner framework. It gives you the tools to create workshops and exercises which can be run from any terminal.
Which is a great thing if you are teaching people how are still scared of the terminal. This way they will practice their programming skills and develop a sense of comfort on the command line.

Workshopper is being used by code schools like "[Learn You Node](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)" and [Nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/). I came across a Hapi.js exercise as well, which made me think why not have an interactive introduction to your framework.

The framework is essentially a test-runner with a very fancy terminal UI.
The `workshopper` package is largely concerned with the menu system and some basic command-line parsing but much of the work for executing the exercise validation is handled by [workshopper-exercise](http://github.com/rvagg/workshopper-exercise).

I really like this project because it's a nice and quick way to really get into how something works. For instance [this workshop on functional Javascript](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop).

If you did not submit you solution to this weeks challenge, creating Tic Tac Toe, I'd advice you to get a move on it because there is only day remaining. If you need to refresh you memory on the challenge head over to [the challenge page](http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/tic-tac-toe/).
