Itâ€™s Friday again, which means no new library today, but to make up for it I think I chose a really nice challenge. The Mandelbrot set.
Some of you guys are probably familiar with it already from school or as a performance test.

I came across this problem just recently when I was looking at the [bigfloat](http://daily-javascript.com/articles/bigfloat/) library.
The developer included it as a performance demo and it got my interest because of ["The Computer Language Benchmarks Game"](http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/performance.php?test=mandelbrot). Where it is listed as one of the benchmarks challenges.

For details on the challenge go to the [challenge page](http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/mandelbrot).

The results will be up next Friday so make sure you have submitted your implementation before then.
