Shem is a new "compiled-to-JS", functional programming language which is statically typed.
The semantics are based on [Haskell]() but the language evaluates strictly in a similar way to [PureScript](). The syntax is S-expressions-based.
This for allowing for a [LISP]()-like macro system. Shem's prelude includes a full-featured, highly-polymorphic collections library backed by [ImmutableJS]().

It comes with an amazing IDE called "[Golem](https://github.com/xixixao/Golem)". This IDE was designed with the language to make the integration seamlessly.
The IDE is available at [shem.io](http://shem.io/) to work with in the browser. There are plan's to make it also accessible as a local IDE for developing applications native platform such as desktop.

There is a video available of what I believe is one of the first presentations check it out to see Shem and Golem in action

When this language interests you, you can go over to IDE and follow a small tutorial to give you a quick overview of how the language works.
If you are familiar with languages such as LISP and Haskell you will feel right at home.
