Today I came across a new online editor platform that really blew me away, called [Webpackbin.com](http://webpackbin.com).

It's a code sharing tool like, [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), [Codepen](http://codepen.io/), [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output) and many more.
The thing which makes this tool stand out is that, as the name suggests, it is based on webpack.
This means that you could use all the awesome features that come with it, features like importing npm modules, using loaders and hot reloading.

Besides the awesome webpack features it also has with a collaborative mode, in which you can share the same session with one or more other developer.
This can be used for teaching, remote collaboration or maybe even for live coding during talks.

The developer has posted [an introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGaJwjVPh9I) demoing these features and more.

I'm really excited about this next generation of online collaboration and curious about what featues the developer might add in the future.
